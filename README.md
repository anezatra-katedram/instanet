## What is a instanet exploiter? 
**Instanet is a penetration toolkit designed for Instagram, encompassing various modules. It can perform brute force attacks and also display texts associated with an account. Additionally, it attempts to view hidden profiles using Google's algorithms**
## How is it working ⚙️
**Google Dorks are special search queries used to find specific information or open to certain types of websites using the Google search engine. These dorks are used to unlock information that would not normally be found in search results and are often used by cybersecurity researchers, web developers, or people searching for information. Instanet is also trying to take advantage of this algorithm.** <br/><br/>
